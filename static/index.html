      if you're having trouble connecting to friends, you may need to disable adblock (on this page only). this is because the lobby server is hosted on a <fixed>.zone</fixed> domain, and for some reason  (apparently related to bitcoin mining scripts???), connections to websocket servers on that TLD are blocked outright in a lot of default blocking lists, including easyprivacy.
